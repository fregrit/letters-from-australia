            This website was created from scratch by Fredrik Fastén, Margareta's son, who was born in 1983. 
            It serves as a tribute to her life and legacy, preserving the letters she wrote from Australia to Sweden in the early 1970s. 
            These letters offer a unique glimpse into a family's journey as they settled into a new life on the other side of the world.
